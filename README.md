# n-beats
Implementation of a paper called n-beats for timeseries forecasting

It uses a different model structure called N-Beats blocks which can be seen in the diagram below:

In the paper, 3 datasets had been used kaggle tourism, m3 and m4 datasets. I could not access these datasets, thus I used a dataset called Gold prices dataset which shows the change of the gold prices from the year 1970 to the year 2020.
